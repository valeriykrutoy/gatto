        <p> Hello Kitty is not a cat. She’s a girl called Kitty White. Confused? We are too.
            <br>The revelation comes from Sanrio, the creators of the international toy, who contacted University of Hawaii anthropologist Christine R. Yano who was putting together a 40th anniversary retrospective of Hello Kitty in Los Angeles. Professor
            Yano, speaking to the LA Times, said: “That's one correction Sanrio made for my script for the show. Hello Kitty is not a cat. She's a cartoon character. She is a little girl. She is a friend. “But she is not a cat. She's never depicted on
            all fours. She walks and sits like a two-legged creature. She does have a pet cat of her own, however, and it's called Charmmy Kitty." According to the official Hello Kitty homepage, Kitty White was born in London on 1 November, and is ‘a
            cheerful and happy little girl with a heart of gold.’ She was born in England, Yano says, because of the culture during the 1970s: "Hello Kitty emerged in the 1970s, when the Japanese and Japanese women were into Britain".

            "They loved the idea of Britain. It represented the quintessential idealized childhood, almost like a white picket fence.
            <br>"So the biography was created exactly for the tastes of that time." Since her creation in 1974, Hello Kitty has become
            <br>a global figure worth an estimated $7 billion to Sanrio.

            <p>It's not the first time there have been doubts raised about who, or what exactly, a cartoon character is. In the 1990s there was discussion surrounding Goofy.
                <br> As much of the internet predictably exploded in shock at the news Kitty was not a cat, there was some good news as Peanuts confirmed that Snoopy,
                <br>the world’s favourite dog, is thankfully a dog.</p>
